  desc: I am a data scientist by profession, and an avid gamer at heart. I'm an extremely organized person who is focused on producing results. While I am always realistic when setting goals, I consistently develop ways to efficiently achieve, and often exceed, those goals. I am always eager to learn new things which will not only help me with my job, but also help me become a better person.   # Describe yourself.
